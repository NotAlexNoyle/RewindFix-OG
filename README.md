# RewindFix-OG
Makes some vehicles (boats, horses, donkeys, mules) usable on versions lower than 1.9 and adds sprint swimming for versions lower than 1.13

Actually mimicking the 1.9 boats is nearly impossible because the <1.9 and 1.9+ clients handle boats completely differently

## TODO
- Overhaul boat steering
